## 🧠 About Me

My academic journey has led me to develop projects involving:

- Data structures  
- File systems  
- GUI applications  
- Programming fundamentals  

I enjoy combining **backend logic** and **front-end creativity** to bring ideas to life — whether it's:

- A collection of exercises  
- A final university project  
- An experimental game or interface  

I'm also passionate about **audiovisual creation** and the **power of visual media**, which blends perfectly with my technical side.  
I believe in **learning by building and sharing ideas**.
